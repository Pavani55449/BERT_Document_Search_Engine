brandishing your knowledge. bruno     you must use your knowledge  to soothe the patient's heart. bruno     farma  think of the patient  bruno     the white death is an incurable illness. bruno     the patient is suffering. bruno     what is the point of  driving them to despair  bruno     a new medicine  bruno     to spout such nonsense is reprehensible. farma     no  father. the medicine exists  farma     and it's... farma     something you need to take as well  bruno     wait  what are you doing  farma     why  bruno     answer me  farma  bruno     what is it that you are  attempting to compound  farma     put your wand away  father  farma     do you mean to destroy the whole lab  bruno     answer  bruno     if you cannot explain  it's poison  bruno     sword dance of ice  bruno

farma     knowledge of new medicines. farma     i dreamed of it the day  i was struck by lightning. bruno     a dream... bruno     and that day was the turning point  farma     yes. bruno     on your shoulder. that's the holy mark. bruno     did the panactheos grant you a revelation  farma     i... couldn't say. bruno     so that's the situation. bruno     this is incredible. bruno     to think the panactheos  granted my son a blessing... farma     please  father  farma     administer this medicine to her majesty  farma     if we say that you compounded it  farma     your standing within the  court will be preserved. bruno     no. bruno     the medicine you make is yours to give. bruno     that has always been my teaching. bruno     her majesty placed her faith  in you and your assessment. bruno     she resolved to stake her life  on your medicine. bruno     thus you  too  must stake your own life  on giving your medicine. bruno     that is a pharmacian's duty   and a pharmacian's pride. farma     yes  father. bruno     farma's attribute was positive water. bruno     even if he can produce water   he should not be able to erase it... bruno     are you... bruno     are you... farma  bruno     are you really my son  farma     i mean  i consider myself to be. farma     ladies and gentlemen  sorry for the wait. court physician a     why is he hiding his face  pharmacian a     what disrespect he shows the empress  court physician a     does it mean he can't face her  claude     that took some time. claude     where is your father   did he turn tail and flee  farma     no. nothing of the sort.   lisabeth ii     the time is of no import. come closer. farma     this is the new medicine  your majesty. claude     chief royal pharmacian   shouldn't you stop your son  bruno     no... bruno     he... his skills may have  already surpassed ours. bruno     all i can do is watch him. farma     before i report the effects  of this new medicine  farma     there is something i would  like your majesty to see. farma     might i have your majesty's cooperation    lisabeth ii     very well. proceed. farma     this is a sputum sample  i obtained from your majesty. farma     please bring that close to your eye and  peer through the hole toward some light.   lisabeth ii     like this    lisabeth ii     what are these    lisabeth ii     i see... they look like creatures      lisabeth ii     claude. claude     pardon me. claude     now then. claude     what are these   bugs  court physician     head court physician  what do you see  court physician     incredible... they look  just like caterpillars. pharmacian     are these living organisms    lisabeth ii     farma  explain what we have witnessed. farma     they're extremely small organisms  that cause the white death. farma     they're bacteria. farma     your majesty's body is being  affected by these organisms.   lisabeth ii     bac teria  you say  farma     there exist diseases in this world caused by  infection with micro organisms like these. farma     the medicine i am giving your majesty farma     operates on the organisms  that cause the white death. farma     if the medicine is taken properly for  half a year  full recovery can be expected. claude     that is quite a long time. farma     the white death is a tenacious malady.   lisabeth ii     farma  your explanation fundamentally  upends our existing concept of disease.   lisabeth ii     very well. i shall take your medicine. farma     as you wish. farma     now then  starting today  farma     i will watch your majesty take  this medicine every day. farma     this is called directly observed  treatment  short course    farma     your majesty.   lisabeth ii     i put myself in your care  farma. farma     your majesty  i  farma de m  dicis  farma     hereby stake my life farma     on your majesty's safe  and effective treatment. farma     here i go. farma     your majesty.   lisabeth ii     yes. farma     ladies and gentlemen  farma     when this new medicine has succeeded in  appropriately eliminating the bacteria  farma     the white death shall cease  to be an incurable disease  farma     never again shall we fear this illness  pharmacian a     young man  just what is this object  pharmacian a     please  spare no detail  court physician a     what a splendid divine art  farma     this is not a divine art.  it is a device anyone can make.   lisabeth ii     farma de m  dicis... farma     i will share the designs. bruno     a pharmacian must be close with patients. bruno     what a pharmacian needs most  is not skill  but heart. bruno     in accordance with that conviction  bruno     i have interacted earnestly with my  patients  and i believe i understood them. bruno     and yet  bruno     i have failed to do even a single  fatherly thing for my son. bruno     i don't even know what my son thought  about  or how he felt about his life. bruno     despite that  i can tell that the boy  before me is not the farma i knew. farma     i'm glad her majesty managed to sleep. farma     i hope she rests well. bruno     y yes. i'm sure your medicine helped. farma     i hope so... farma     um  these are for you. farma     if you're willing to take them  that is. bruno     the panactheos has blessed you. bruno     a god's will cannot be comprehended  bruno     but i imagine this is a reminder that  i have much room for improvement. bruno     if it is my guardian deity's will   then i can only obey. farma     you are mistaken. farma     though i had knowledge  farma     i didn't understand the needs of  a patient on the verge of death. farma     that is something you taught me. farma     though i have been granted these abilities  farma     i am still only an  apprentice level pharmacian. farma     my acumen is shallow and unrefined. farma     so please  farma     as someone deeply immersed in medicine  farma     continue to show me the way. farma     let's pursue the path of medicine together  farma     father. bruno     thank you  bruno     my son.       ending theme song....          inori no koe kakikesu you ni              moroi kanjou wa

marky yet not since he found out you're an avatar that came out of my phone girl i've never seen someone scream so loud and run so fast and i've seen your father around a cricket and that's after we explained everything to marky yeah now that he knows my secret we got to make sure he's cool otherwise he's gonna tell your parents and they'll know we've been lying to them there's nothing my parents

anything strange about her or did i notice and you made me forget do you have mind wipe powers stop wiping my mind she didn't you just didn't notice anything strange about her because there's nothing strange to notice besides you're a year old who wears a sweater vest i wouldn't talk little one marky this is a good thing when lay lay was in my phone she was an avatar for my positive affirmation app yes i'm really good at helping people become the best versions of themselves look at me because of lay lay i'm more outgoing and i'm the president of my class now she even gave me the confidence to become an era era dj some people say i got it going in on out whatever people are talking i'm talking about how just hours ago i saw you turn invisible okay did it scare you please i'm done

happy with us now ok right for those wanting to transfer to a bus or an express bus please exit now the exit for the busan west intercity bus terminal is exit gimhae international airport is how's your knee huh your knees hurt right yes i'm okay you okay oh it's gotten a lot better okay you should come more often it'll be good for you to exercise it's been a while so i just want to rest whenever i come here is the laundry doing well these days it's so so hey socrates by the way i can't believe they're thinking of using baby boxes for human trafficking that's really bold it's their fault for making those boxes in the first place it's creating irresponsible mothers you have a nice side to you why oh that baby he would've died if he had been left on that floor i am nice you didn't know was it a boy or a girl hello how have you been you worked hard that dish last time was really good it was shu shu schweinshaxen oh schweinshaxen the day after i was so surprised because my skin was so smooth what are you saying it's just pig's feet and uh do you happen to know choucroute i'm gonna try making that next you should come to have a bite it's just boiled pork it's bland i left the white one at the laundry i brought it in black instead it's thick oh thanks and this too just in case right thanks go okay go okay take care yeah okay whatever the situation is you should get out of the car and say goodbye it's fine he stays home all day anyways it's good for him to get some exercise he's a perfect match for a marriage partner oh really what about it do you want him because even if you have a kid he can look after the kid since he writes from home the baby's mother came to see him is something wrong yes they left the baby outside outside the box could it have been a mistake because she was flustered hey if you think they're gonna go to the police just bring the baby here ok i'll do that okay there's nothing on the records call the pastor and can you please give soo kyung a bath for me ok sure you were on night watch yesterday right yes every sunday can you show her some of the babies you have now this is a playroom for big kids there are kids living here they're all abandoned in the baby box he came in last week the mother was years old his mom is from pakistan she said she was a babysitter that's it yes for now what about letters did you put a letter with the baby yes how about your name and contact number did you write that too so even if you have a baby there's no evidence that you're the mother what's going on she's looking for a baby named woosung she says she left a baby outside the baby box yesterday if you had put the baby in the box our staff would have gone out right away and spoken to you yes that's what i said peek a boo peek a boo of course not kidnapping what are you talking about hey don't you think so you threw him away what are you talking about i just left him with you for a bit do you think we're like a dog hotel i even wrote in the letter that i'd come and pick him up if there's a message saying you're coming back for the baby the church takes the baby off the adoption list he's going to a childcare facility do you know what that means well i'm sure you did it out of love but that's what narrows down this kid's future possibilities we uh woosung we want to save woosung from that dark future it's better for him to grow up in a nice home than to be an orphan in a childcare facility it's much better adoption we're looking for parents to raise him you don't have the right to do that you don't have the right either you abandoned him you stole him to protect yes of course we don't have the right we don't in other words should i say it's with good intentions good intentions i haven't heard those words in a while there are people wanting children but can't have them and can't wait for the screening period we can send the baby to those parents you're in an explainable situation your name is it's seon ah moon seon ah miss seon ah you can think of us as a cupid that sends your precious baby to those parents i promise to find the best adoptive parents for woosung cupid my ass yeah well it's a bit strange to call us that what's another good name should we call ourselves the storks since it's two of us two storks oh and it's case by case but there's a little reward a reward how much was it it's about million won for a boy for who of course for you and us the mediators good intentions my ass you're just a broker to put it simply yes when is the departure get some rest yes go home yes she's the mother of that baby right i'm not sure she doesn't look like it oh taeho what are doing h oh hello we're temporarily closed for today i don't know if this can be removed oh this this is it's obviously blood i'll

let ha jun borrow it now haejin that's enough football five more minutes please he's not improving much that kid i see that the scar is still there you bled so much when that happened i called the ambulance and everything it was crazy there was a kite on the branch i was going to grab it when it broke young min is the only troublemaker like that now young min oh young min he's escaping now again at least that hasn't changed i haven't heard from him sorry to say that's not why i visit anymore well at first it's like a blind date toe okay i'll take a picture and send it to you okay his eyebrows are a bit thin huh excuse me for a second that's weird huh what he looks strong with this but why am i playing the wife everyone here knows dong soo oh it's a baby then you can tell them i'm your daughter so cute we don't look alike at all hey kid don't touch him your hands are dirty from the ball i said don't touch him and we're doing this until someone comes to buy him what's the big deal hey don't touch him your hands are dirty from the ball he has weird eyebrows can i be your son why i want to play football football i want to make a lot of money like son heung min well it hasn't been long since woosung was born and it's too early to talk about a second kid right right one's enough it would be a good suggestion there was a kid from here who became a professional footballer he wore what was it the team with stripes on their uniforms no idea well these facilities they promote saying even people like us can succeed but stop being a smart ass is great too look at him getting riled up about this place what percent of the average is successful then who is it they said he escaped must've been caught and brought back i broke dong soo's record it took them days to catch me that's nothing to brag about considering time and distance i was much ahead you must be real proud yes hello okay i understand you're in uljin right no no that's alright what the hell we'll see you tomorrow what's up with your eyebrows here is your order seafood doenjang the coin laundromat this is si woo he was a grade below me i was the forward buttons and he was the midfielder do they attach the buttons back then we would've made two football teams don't you think so well now when i go as a coach i take the seams out from pants they shortened players the worn out knees they don't put a lining right no there's no one you know that law adoption yeah the adoption law the conditions for overseas adoptions became more strict so i thought it was good but don't all the kids want to be adopted oh well that kid that likes football he seems very active yes haejin it's already too late for him he's years old he's oh too late too late too late for him adoption you can say that's only for kids below even he should know by now there are also kids that come because they don't want it there was a case like that recently remember the adopted child was abused it's because blood is thicker than water think about what would've happened if the parents had a biological baby after the adoption yeah that's for most of the kids here at least once right they were denied of their existence when they were abandoned right and they experience it again then i've been denied all my life what then do something about that whistle you're not the military hey the whistle for me it's like me wanting to be like a father to them understand so that's why i'm using this whistle like this ok hey hurry up and hide good night my baby in the front garden and back garden birds and baby sheep they're all asleep she was singing what song a lullaby a lullaby it's so nice here because they have everything you need let's take it all rub his earlobes like this you talk too much well if we search a little more we could find a someone with better conditions just go with the ones in uljin all done you were so good during your bath your mom wants to say goodbye to you as soon as possible we're working so hard do you know how hard it is to raise a child by yourself that's still not a reason to abandon your child how are you going to justify selling them there are people selling them because there are people abandoning them that's the right order then you shouldn't have made that box that's what i'm saying it's only there to make the mothers feel at ease by telling them we're saving the baby or whatever that's not the case woosung is alive because of that box that wipe has alcohol in it you can't wipe his face with that look at him crying sorry i'm sorry then how many mothers do you think come back for them after leaving only a letter behind how would i know it's one out of forty you never hear from the other ever again why are you only complaining about the mothers say the same about the dads you could've at least left your contacts in the letter this is the second time hearing that what you want me to tell you again i can tell you many times as you want who are you to be so arrogant do you think you're something because the kids call you big brother at this pathetic place you feel proud then just stay here oh it's cold he thought his mother would be one in forty well you see that old door there outside at the playground over there they said he was abandoned there with a letter saying i'll be back to get you that's the reason why he's so grumpy so please cut him some slack jiyoung was working yeah she came back becoming a singer was never gonna happen i liked her voice though to well we all settle down here but it looks fun yeah to fun it's more fun than being alone i suppose still you should go far away far far away where far you're the hope and the star for us kids where am i supposed to go anywhere i think it'll be sad if you do come back really good morning woosung it's raining it's raining this is a raindrop it's the same thing i'm sorry about yesterday i was too harsh i don't remember i have these dreams sometimes it's raining and the rain washes me clean from everything of my past but when i open my eyes it's still pouring and nothing has changed wouldn't it be okay if you had an umbrella an umbrella yes a big umbrella something that two people can use stop it i hope it's red one with strawberries on it when i was young my friend had something like that i was so jealous you stole it yeah i took it and threw it away

the market price do you want to meet them huh who i think it's the owner of the building how old is the woman why you want someone younger no it's not that i have a bad feeling about this though isn't this too cheap million the market price for the baby a girl baby only costs million won miss yeah using bait to provoke crime two million won isn't that against the law what's the difference this is pissing me off what did you say i've learned that it's not even taken as evidence in a trial they had intentions to commit the crime from the start this isn't crime induction it's giving them an

you cooled it down isn't it because it's too hot it was fine is it because he got wet yesterday i'm sorry woosung no it's not your fault no i don't think it's just a cold have you ever done it before we have to take him to the hospital hyung we can't do that we might get caught it's not like meningitis right since yesterday his fever suddenly went up will he get better what if he dies is he your little brother yes he'll be fine he won't die it looks like a cold but make sure that you keep an eye on him so that it doesn't spread into pneumonia for now i'll give you a fever reducer if his fever doesn't go down come back tomorrow woosung that's great what's sadder than love is affection will the baby be okay everyone's making a fuss anyway it's just a cold well that's true but but it'll be a big problem if he doesn't get better soon are you afraid they won't be able to sell him well if they can't sell him we can't catch them in the act i thought since you're in the department for women and adolescents i thought you should've cast your net a little higher up the river than the detectives higher up the river shouldn't you have saved her first before she abandoned the baby that's the department of health's job okay before she throws him away it's department of health's case after she abandons him it's the police's seriously team leader why are you so cold to that woman she's irresponsible because she gave birth to him and threw him away but we can't conclude that she's the same do you understand how a mother feels about abandoning her child i guess i can't he can't do this this isn't a playground right yes this is are you his father oh yes there are a lot of patients here okay please be careful yes okay are you woosung's father yeah oh yes what's his resident registration number got it yes okay actually he's only one month old so one month everyone was surprised is it because of that powdered milk that that american brand what was it similac similac his grandmother is in the countryside yes i wonder how many she sent me i know she must be so happy to have her first grandchild okay then woosung's father please come this way oh okay gosh that kid he plays soccer all the time that's why the owner always squeaks jin jin ja ra jiri jiri ja jin jin ja ra jiri jiri ja what's wrong with him and how thank you for taking care of woosung well babies get fever and they grow up if i were alone i wouldn't be able to do anything you don't have to do it all by yourself the father of woosung i was against it from the beginning i see she probably ran away with the baby find him and bring him back the girl the baby what are you going to do with the baby i'm going to raise him i will because he's my husband's child it's fully automatic are you kidding me how do you do this oh taeho uh i'm sorry but i'll rush the money what baby who who woosung's father how much four thousand he's totally asleep i guess he's tired you've been worrying about him all day he looks like siwoo these types don't sell well and get left behind didn't you want to be adopted i really liked it there that's why i refused to talk about adoption because your mom said she'd pick you up what else did hyung tell you um he told me about the letter 'cause i never thought i'd be abandoned he fell asleep do you want to try please just do me a favor put his chin on your shoulder i know i know no a little higher i said i know hey that's too weak oh you're too loud just you're not taking care of woosung on purpose are you huh i'm afraid you won't be able to part ways later why are you laughing it's perfect for girls why are you saying the same thing as hyung where are you going convenience store do you want me to go instead there are things that women can't ask others to do bring an umbrella in case it rains come and pick me up if it rains with an umbrella i don't want to i'll be back where did you meet that mother i was sleeping on songdo beach after running away from home and she told me to come if i was hungry and then you were forced to prostitute yourself do you pity me no that's not what i meant i did it even before i met his mom then why did you kill him it's because of well fit of rage in a fit of rage he's telling me to lick it before i take a shower that crazy bastard so the first other person i mean was it self defense or if you want to know the list of the other customers i can tell you that's enough all i want to know is is this an interrogation or a sermon like i said the baby will be sold so don't worry my team leader and i want to help you have you ever abandoned a child have you ever killed a man okay then tell me because i don't understand why did you throw him away outside the church you saw that if you left him like that he'd be dead that's because i didn't want to see him again why did you give birth to him if you couldn't raise him are you saying i should've aborted him if you're thinking about the child don't you have that option is it lighter crime to kill the child before giving birth than to throw it away after giving birth well since no one wants them aren't babies more unhappy when they're born you're saying i should've killed him before he was born you talk like that in front of woosung what did you mean by throwing him away yes uh you know can you get me some clothes my buttons fell off yes in uljin right no it's okay look at this hold on listen to this song hello oh can you hear it do you remember this in the movie we watched together the one that came out that's right in reality well that's not gonna

after her dad so our house is ruined it's okay we don't live together that's all superstition oh she's the eldest daughter shut up whenever i see pictures of my mom i get surprised i thought it was me the button was about to fall off now okay where are you going to wash up even he doesn't know his parents' faces either living without knowing there are cases like that it's better if woosung doesn't know my face why do you think so because i'm a murderer murder yes who'd you kill woosung's biological father why he shouldn't have been born like this i was going to take woosung away what his wife is probably after me by now so if you're going to sell it properly you can leave me behind uh i'm out of the motel right now okay hold on uh wait let me ask you something hyung what are you doing here

there might be a reason why she had to abandon me but still you don't have to forgive her because it doesn't change the fact that she's a terrible mother that's why i will forgive you instead woosung will never forgive me you threw away woosung because you didn't want to make him a murderer's child but still i threw him away i guess i was the one who wanted to sell him the most we're more like brokers was it when you were young you were in my arms you almost threw up but you didn't throw up i hugged you against my stomach i don't remember i was years old has it been that long how can you solve such a difficult question already why who is it mom why answer it what is it a text message text her back should we take a selfie and send it to her it's fine here's your order enjoy your meal

must never forget it he will forget it soon you just have to remember everything even on woosung's behalf gosh this kid no matter how you look at it he's really unfortunate i totally agree woosung we really had fun today so let's not forget about today in the future so young doesn't talk to woosung no no i've never seen it before either it's the last day say something what should i say well anything well thank you for being born there well people usually say something like that what he doesn't even understand anything even if he doesn't understand he would want to hear it at least once sister then tell us everything everything yes everything here yes this idiot i'll pass what if she talks first to him then i'll pass too fine i'll talk to him everyone close your eyes then w wait wait

sang hyun thank you for being born dong soo thank you for being born woosung thank you for being born so young so young thank you for being born too now now let's sleep everyone good night i'll make a suggestion let's say you turn yourself in what woosung you don't have to sell him anymore what you said to sell him and now i shouldn't if you turn yourself in you'll be on parole for the first time in three years then you can live with woosung again someday those two people cannot become parents i'm afraid i agree the couple i met today was like that woosung is not abandoned he's a protected child he'll grow up talking about that every day i hope woosung grows up under that kind of people then then he doesn't have to live like me where are you going so young isn't here either so young is
